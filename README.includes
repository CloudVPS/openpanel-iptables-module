The IPTables module will include files with the ".inc" extension from
/etc/openpanel/iptables.d into the iptables output.

Files in this directory must contain lines starting with either:
	$IPTABLES for rules related to IPv4
	$IP6TABLES for rules related to IPv6

Includes are handled after the rules defined inside the module. If you
need a rule to be on top, use -I instead of -A.
